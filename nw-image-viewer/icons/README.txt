- Use online converters like https://cloudconvert.com/png-to-icns
- Use the Image2Icon app: https://img2icnsapp.com/

### Windows (.ico)
You can create an .ico file using the following methods:
- Use online converters like https://convertio.co/png-ico/

## Placeholder Icons
If you don't have custom icons yet, you can download free placeholder icons from:

Remember to convert them to the appropriate format (.icns for macOS and .ico for Windows).
